# Bank API

> Bank API built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

The API is already built for you and not part of the exercise.

Refer to https://aka.ms/NodeBeginner (videos 17 through 21 covers this exact API).

> Note: all entries are stored in-memory and are not persisted, so when the server is stopped all data is lost.
